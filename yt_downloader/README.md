# YouTube downloader introduction

This YouTube downloader is based on [this video](https://youtu.be/NI9LXzo0UY0) which I found to be quite informative and a great base to start. I searched online for fun Python GUI projects to do which don't take so much time since I had school classes at the same time. Program is very simple and uses Pythons built in libraries tkinter, customtkinter, pathlib and Pytubefix.

This was also my first time using VSCode Copilot while coding and it made those repetative steps so much easier.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python installed and do a pip install on tkinter, customtkinter, pathlib and pytubefix.
2. Clone this repo or just download the Python file.
3. Run the file by ```python main.py.```

## Usage

1. Copy the link of the video you want and paste it into the input field.
2. Click download button.
3. Video will start downloading and progress bar is updated in real-time. (Some YouTube videos may not be downloadable due to restrictions.)
4. Video will be saved in users downloads folder.

### Possible adjustments

1. Make the download location choosable from the GUI. :heavy_check_mark:
2. Audio only?
3. Possible to choose quality of video to save space and possibility to choose the file name before downloading.
4. Download whole playlists by once and error handling to those.
5. Theme toggle button.
